### [Popularity Percentage](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10284-popularity-percentage?code_type=1) Hard

#### Q. Find the popularity percentage for each user on Meta/Facebook. The popularity percentage is defined as the total number of friends the user has divided by the total number of users on the platform, then converted into a percentage by multiplying by 100. Output each user along with their popularity percentage. Order records in ascending order by user id. The 'user1' and 'user2' column are pairs of friends.

```diff
with base AS (
    select user1, user2
    from facebook_friends
    UNION 
    select user2, user1
    from facebook_friends
)
SELECT user1
    , 100* count(user2) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user1) FROM base)::decimal popularity
FROM base
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

### [Risky Projects](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10304-risky-projects?code_type=1) Medium

#### Q. Identify projects that are at risk for going overbudget. A project is considered to be overbudget if the cost of all employees assigned to the project is greater than the budget of the project. You'll need to prorate the cost of the employees to the duration of the project. For example, if the budget for a project that takes half a year to complete is 10K, then the total half-year salary of all employees assigned to the project should not exceed 10K,thenthetotalhalfâˆ’yearsalaryofallemployeesassignedtotheprojectshouldnotexceed10K. Salary is defined on a yearly basis, so be careful how to calculate salaries for the projects that last less or more than one year. Output a list of projects that are overbudget with their project name, project budget, and prorated total employee expense (rounded to the next dollar amount).

```diff
with tab as (select lep.project_id, lp.title,lp.budget, 
            lp.budget/(lp.end_date - lp.start_date) as per_day_cost,  
            le.salary from linkedin_projects lp
            left join linkedin_emp_projects lep
            on lp.id = lep.project_id
            right join linkedin_employees le
            on le.id = lep.emp_id),

sal as(select t.project_id, sum(t.salary)/365 per_day_sal from tab t 
        group by 1 order by 1)

select distinct tab.title, tab.budget, ceil(sal.per_day_sal) expense from tab right join sal on tab.project_id = sal.project_id
    where sal.per_day_sal > tab.per_day_cost
    order by 1;

### [Acceptance Rate By Date](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10285-acceptance-rate-by-date?code_type=1) Medium

#### Q. What is the overall friend acceptance rate by date? Your output should have the rate of acceptances by the date the request was sent. Order by the earliest date to latest.
Assume that each friend request starts by a user sending (i.e., user_id_sender) a friend request to another user (i.e., user_id_receiver) that's logged in the table with action = 'sent'. If the request is accepted, the table logs action = 'accepted'. If the request is not accepted, no record of action = 'accepted' is logged.


```diff
with q1 as (select fr1.date, count(fr1.date) as dcnt
from fb_friend_requests fr1
join fb_friend_requests fr2
on fr1.user_id_sender = fr2.user_id_sender and 
    fr1.user_id_receiver = fr2.user_id_receiver and 
    fr1.action != fr2.action
where fr1.action = 'sent'
group by fr1.date),

q2 as (select q.date, count(q.action) as cnt
from (select * from fb_friend_requests where action='sent')q
group by q.date)

select q1.date, (q1.dcnt*1.0)/(1.0*q2.cnt)::float as acc_Rate
